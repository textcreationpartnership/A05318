            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I think thou canſt not ſo much forget thy ſelfe, as to thinke of the fruition of pleaſures ſo dearely bought.

               <p>How many like vnto thy ſelfe, haue endeuored to bee

From whom ſudden death hath ſuddenly, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether taken away, what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their wickedneſſe hath neither ſuddenly nor toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gotten to themſelues. They haue left their riches ill gotten &amp; found puniſhment neuer ſought for: Their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the graue are deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with wormes, their ſouls in hell tormented by diuels. And euen ſo thou deteineſt with thy ſelfe many things vniuſtly gotten, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe thou art ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to die, thou ſhalt neuer ſpend; and yet thou ſhalt giue an account of them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and for them bee
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8926:58"/>damned in hell; and it ſhall nothing pleaſure thee among thy torments, nay it ſhall hurt thee much, that thou dideſt heere poſſeſſe them. But behold, almightie God who iudgeth our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hath called thoſe firſt to iudgement, doth ſtill expect thee to repentance, and doth beare with thee that thou maiſt turne vnto him. He hath already pronouneed his ſentence againſt them, &amp; leſt thy ſoule ſhould likewiſe periſh with theirs, hee pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expecteth thy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and prorogeth his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. But thou ſtill perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in thy ſinnes, nay thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day heapeſt ſinne vpon ſinne. For as often as thou thinkeſt with thy ſelfe, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8926:59"/>thou keepeſt another mans goods wrongfully, againſt the wil of the true owner, and yet purpoſeſt ſtill to keep it, &amp; not reſtore it, ſo often thou committeſt a new ſinne. Now conſider with thy ſelfe how often by this meanes thou haſt ſinned. Thou haſt many times ſince the detention and poſſeſſion of thy vnlawfull gaine, repented thee of thy ſinne, but God knoweth to ſmall purpoſe, for thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ſinne.

O miſerable man and of a prepoſterous iudgement! do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou feare the puniſhment of this life, and feareſt thou not the ſorrowes of hell?</p>
               <p>Wherefore (deare brother) quit thy ſelfe of thoſe fading &amp; corruprible goods. which thou vniuſtly deteineſt; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore vnto thy neighbor that

Without the great mercy of God thou canſt not attaine to the ioies of heauen, except thou make reſtitution of the vttermoſt farthing.

Wilt thou haue good meat, good garments, good ſeruants, to be ſhort, all good, and thy ſelfe onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? Preferre thy life before them, let not al theſe be good and deare vnto thee, &amp; thou onely vile and baſe and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to thy ſelfe. If thou wilt bee lord of ſo many good things, indeuour that they haue thee a good lord too: which thou canſt hardly bee, except thou make reſtitution of that which thou vniuſtly detaineſt. A good life is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to poſſeſſe much goods. Temporall goods are
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8926:72"/>only good, inaſmuch as they are helpes to vertue; but if they exceed this end, and hinder the vſe of vertue, they are no more good things, but to bee accounted among the euill. Canſt thou thinke that another mans goods vniuſtly deteined, which make thee euill, can be good vnto thee? Or canſt thou thinke thoſe things good that ſubiect thee to eternall euils? What good ſoeuer there is in this world, whoſe gift is it but his that created it? But that gift of God ought not to pleaſe thee, that by the delight thereof ſeparateth thee from the loue of God. Preferre not the gift before the giuer; &amp; when thou receiueſt good things, bee not euill thy ſelfe,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8926:72"/>and let not that that ſhould encreaſe thy loue towards God, ſeparate thee farther from him, and ſo thou loue a baſe creature more than thy Creator, to whem thou ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all that thou art, and all that thou haſt, who hath made thee, and made thee good, who when it pleaſeth him, can take that from thee, that he hath giuen thee, who can caſt both thy bodie and ſoule into hell, and beſtow thy temporall goods vpon another man. But thou that loueſt thy gold more than God, honoreſt it more than God, for if thou diddeſt not ſo, thou wouldeſt not for that loſe the grace and loue of God. Thou ſelleſt God for a halfe-penny, becauſe for the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8926:73"/>gaine of a halfe-penny, thou breakeſt the commandement of God. God forbids thee to ſteale, and thou obeieſt him not; couetouſneſſe bids thee to ſteale, and that thou doeſt: God commands thee to cloth the naked, and that thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt; couetouſnes mooues thee to take from another what is his, and that thou art ready to put in execution.</p>
               <p>Thou poſſeſſeſt riches no otherwiſe, than a priſoner doth his ſhakles, which hee ſeemeth rather to be enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, than to haue. For thou art not a little afflicted with thy ſelf, when thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thy brains, &amp; with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome deſires, and a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience, deuiſeſt which way thou maieſt make ſuch a

For as wood caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, ſeemeth for a time to preſſe downe the flame, and dead the fire, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently maketh it burne with greater violence, ſo thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe is not extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gaine, but more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed: And when by right or by wrong, thou haſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thy riches together, and glutted (as it were) thy own deſires, whereas before thou diddeſt hope for reſt out of abundance, thou ſhalt finde thy ſelfe more afflicted than
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8926:74"/>euer, by the care thou haſt to keepe that thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and thou ſhalt euer keep thy riches with no leſſe fear, than with labour thou haſt got them. Thou art euery day in feare to bee aſſaulted, and the wrongs thou haſt offered to others, thou feareſt will be offered by others vnto thee. If thou ſee one mightier than thy ſelfe, thou feareſt his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, his violence; if poorer than thy ſelfe, thou ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt his theft; and ſo thou that in aduerſitie didſt hope for proſperitie, in proſperitie fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt aduerſitie, and art caried hither and thither, as it were with ſo many billowes, and tormented with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers viciſſitude of thy owne fortunes.</p>

So long as thou deſireſt tranſitorie things, and either vnderſtandeſt not eternall, or vnderſtanding them contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt them, thou walloweſt in the dung of thy earthly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and thinkeſt of nothing

               <p>Is not that traueller beſides himſelfe, that in his iourney paſſing thorow beautiful and delightfull medowes, there ſtayes, and forgets to goe to his iourneyes end? If thou haddeſt power to rule ſome

What is the time of this preſent life, but a continuall race vnto death, wherein no man is permitted to ſtay a little, or to ſlacken his pace? What is it to liue, but inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to run vnto death? By how much the longer thou liueſt, by ſo much the neerer thou art vnto death; and as life paſſeth, ſo death draweth on. As a barrell the more it runneth out, the more it is emptied, and yet is not ſayd to be emptie till the laſt drop be fallen from it; ſo by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine droppes of time, the life

In the middle of thy life thou art in death, and whether thou watch or fleepe, thou dieſt continually. Euery day thou dieſt, euery day thou art changed, and yet doeſt thou thinke thy ſelfe immortall? Hee eaſilie contemneth all things, that thinks euery day is his dying day. If thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thinke that theſe earthly bleſſings muſt one day pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, thou wouldeſt vſe them whileſt thou haſt them, for the benefit of thy ſoule.

               <p>BVt perhaps thou wilt ſay I confeſſe that I vniuſtly deteine other mens goods; but yet I giue much almes, &amp; do much good with them; I comfort thoſe that are in priſon, I cloath the naked, I receiue ſtrangers. <hi>Reſ.</hi> Thou doeſt benefit thy ſelfe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all (my deare bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) if thou comfort one by wronging another: Thou thinkeſt thou giueſt, &amp; thou giueſt nothing that is thine owne; take not away, and thou haſt giuen. Doeſt thou thinke to iuſtifie thy theft
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8926:77"/>thy extortion, if out of the goods of the poore thou giue a ſmall almes? One is fedde, where many hunger; and with the ſpoiles of many, few are clothed. Hee to whom thou giueſt, reioyceth; hee from whom thou takeſt, mourneth; hee prayeth for thee, the other crieth for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vnto the Lord againſt thee: which of theſe two will the Lord heare? Feare thou that he will heare him that curſeth, as the Lord himſelfe witneſſeth. There was a Iudge, ſaith he, in a certaine citie, which feared not God, neither reuerenced man: and there was a widow in that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which came vnto him, ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</note> Do me iuſtice againſt mine aduerſarie. And hee
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8926:78"/>would not doe it for a time: but afterward hee ſayd with himſelfe, Though I feare not God, nor reuerence man, yet becauſe this widow trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth me, I will do her right, leſt at the laſt ſhee come and make me wearie. And the Lord ſayd, Heare what the vnrighteous Iudge ſayeth. Now ſhall God auenge his Elect, which cried day and night vnto him, yea though hee ſuffer long for them. I tell you, he will auenge them quickly.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt heereby, that God approoueth not ſuch almes, neither doth it pleaſe him that one ſhould be relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of the loſſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that that ſhould bee violentlie taken from one,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8926:78"/>which is mercifully giuen to another. That almes is not acceptable vnto God, which is gotten by vnlawfull and vniuſt meanes, but that only which is giuen by a iuſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour, out of goods iuſtlie gotten. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſacrifices gotten by robbery, the Lord refuſeth, ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.8.</note> I the Lord loue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hate robbery for burnt offering. Which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> doth likewiſe inſinuate, ſaying,

With how great hatred God beholdeth ſuch a ſacrifice, appeareth in that it is compared to the ſorrow of a father for the death of his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8926:79"/>childe: for what thing can bee more intolerable than a ſlaine ſonne before the eies of his father? But thou that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt by violence, what out of pitie thou giueſt vnto God, thinkeſt with thy ſelfe how much thou giueſt, but not how much thou haſt taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; thou numbreſt thy gift, but thou thinkeſt not of thy ſinne. Thou giueſt thine, nay another mans, vnto God, &amp; thou giueſt thy ſelfe to the diuell. Thou thinkeſt that God puts his iuſtice to ſale, if whileſt thou giueſt vnto God for thy oppreſſion, thou thinkeſt thou mayeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oppreſſe ſcotfree; yea, thou makeſt God a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in thy ſinne, in that thou thinkeſt he conſenteth to thy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8926:79"/>ſinne, by accepting an almes of goods gotten by ſinne. It is one thing to doe the workes of mercy for ſinne, another to ſinne to doe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: if that may bee called mercy, which by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed ſinne of robberie or oppreſſion confoundeth whatſoeuer good there is in mercy.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe thy goods are lawfullie gotten, and thou haſt neuer wronged and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet canſt thou thinke that it is lawfull for thee, to keepe thoſe goods vnprofitablie that may doe good to manie, wherof thou art made by thy heauenlie maſter, not a lord, but a ſteward? When thou miniſtreſt neceſſarie things to thoſe that want, thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8926:80"/>not thine, but thou reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to them their own; thou doeſt rather pay a debt of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, than execute a worke of mercy; and in doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, thou doeſt euery day almoſt kill as many as die for want of comfort, when thou canſt giue it them. But thou, when thou giueſt a ſmall matter to thy God, in his poore members, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all thou haſt vnto thee, hauing oppreſſed thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, canſt thou thinke him abundantly ſatisfied if thou giue that vnto him thou haſt wrongfully taken from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Thou muſt not helpe one with the hurt of another: Though thou giue much to the poore, yet thou art not quit of thy theft, vntill thou
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8926:80"/>haue giuen to him from whom thou haſt taken. Thou oughteſt not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto thy ſelfe, that thing thou haſt found, if thou bee any way aſſured that the right maſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath not forſaken it, but ſeeketh after it.

Wherefore (deare brother) thinke not thy ſelfe heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after iuſtified in this, if of thy goods wrongfully got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thou giue vnto the poore; if thou violently take from one, and mercifullie giue
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8926:81"/>vnto an other; for almes out of thy goods well gotten cannot iuſtifie, as being but the fruits of that faith that muſt iuſtifie.</p>

Thou art in debt, and others indebted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. Thou art a debtour to God for manie and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous offences, thy brother is indebted vnto thee for ſmall and ſleight iniuries. Behold then how louing and eaſie a condition God offereth, that is, that thou ſhouldeſt forgiue what is owing thee, and what thou oweſt ſhall bee forgiuen
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8926:82"/>vnto thee. Otherwiſe thy ſinnes can no way bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee, if thou ſhew thy ſelfe inexorable to forgiue thy neighbour; in vaine thou hopeſt of pardon for thy ſins, except thou firſt pardon his. For though the God of peace and conſolation can without this forgiue all thy ſinnes, yet foraſmuch as he is willing, to miniſter vnto thee an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pity and meekneſſe, hee conſidereth thy charity and mercie towards thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that hee may conferre vpon thee his charity and mercy. And therefore hee commandeth, When ye ſhall ſtand and pray, forgiue, if ye haue anie thing againſt anie man, that your father alſo which is in Heauen may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8926:83"/>you your treſpaſſes.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.25.</note> For if you will not forgiue, your father which is in Heauen will not pardon you your treſpaſſes. So that thou ſeeſt, that to obtaine forgiueneſſe at Gods hands, thou needeſt not to paſſe the Seas, to make long iourneies, to clime high mountaines, to disburſe great ſummes of money: but the Lord that deſireth rather to finde him that hee may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, than that hee may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, putteth it as it were in thy own power to auoid the ſeuerity of his iudgement.</p>
               <p>As long as thou continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in this life thou canſt not be without ſinne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were wiſdome in thee to embrace ſo gentle a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as by forgiuing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8926:83"/>mans ſinnes, to blot out thy owne; being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by another man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue him, if thou deſire to be forgiuen of God; to pardon a light offence to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (for whatſoeuer one man can commit againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is but light) that God may pardon thee ſo manie millions of ſinnes. There is no better meanes (after thy ſinne) to bee reconciled vnto God, than that thou being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with thy brother bee reconciled vnto him. If thou ſeeke after the multitude and magnitude of the mercies of God, doe thou likewiſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and magnifie thy owne mercies towards thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that ſhewing mercie, thou maieſt receiue mercie.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8926:84"/>For though God haue need of no mans helpe, and be free from all ſin, yet he forgiueth his ſeruant thoſe infinite wrongs hee receiueth; how much more then oughteſt thou, that haſt need of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and art guilty of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſinnes, to forgiue the wrong that is offered by thy fellow ſeruant? With what face canſt thou looke that God ſhould pardon thee thy ſinnes, when thou wilt not pardon thy neighbour his? Wilt thou haue God to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his mercy vpon thee, and wilt thou exerciſe thy ſeuere iudgement vpon thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Thou ſhalt haue no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe at the day of iudgement, becauſe thou ſhalt be iudged according to thy owne ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8926:84"/>&amp; that thou halt done vnto others, thou ſhalt ſuffer thy ſelfe: Thou ſhalt haue iudgement without mercie, that ſheweſt no mercie vnto thy brother; For what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment art thou not woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, who maieſt with ſo great facilitie obtain mercie at Gods hands, and yet art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to betray thy owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation?</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus when hee preſcribed a forme of praier vnto vs, and taught vs to pray, promiſed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly mercy; but yet he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a law, that we ſhould ſo begge forgiueneſſe for our treſpaſſes, as wee forgiue thoſe that treſpaſſe againſt vs. Yea ſoraſmuch as hee knew that all men are lyers,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8926:85"/>and that if their ſins ſhould bee firſt forgiuen them, they would not afterwards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue their treſpaſſers, hee commanded we ſhould firſt forgiue them, before we aske forgiueneſſe at his hands. But thou, with what hope canſt thou pray, that ſtill reſerueſt rancour in thy heart againſt another? For as thou praying lieſt, when thou ſaieſt, I forgiue others their treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, &amp; yet forgiueſt them not; ſo when thou praieſt that thy treſpaſſes may bee forgiuen thee of God, they are not forgiuen. For it is as much as if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, forgiue not mee my treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes committed againſt thee, becauſe I forgiue not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their treſpaſſes againſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8926:85"/>mee. When thou powreſt out ſuch praiers vnto God (who conſidereth the heart, not the word) thou art for a threefold cauſe made guiltie. Firſt becauſe thou art a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and goeſt about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue God, whileſt thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt vnto him, to forgiue thy debts, as thou forgiueſt thy debtors, and yet thou forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt them not, thou ſpareſt them in nothing. Secondly, becauſe though thou madeſt not this praier vnto God, yet thou oughteſt to forgiue thy brother his debts. Thirdly, though it were not thy dutie to doe it, yet foraſmuch as being warned by thy Iudge, thou ceaſeſt not, thou exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateſt the anger of the Iudge againſt thee. What
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8926:86"/>hope of forgiueneſle canſt thou haue, if at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant when thou praieſt vnto God, and beggeſt mercy at his hands, thou miniſter grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion to ſtirre vp his anger againſt thee? As if a man ſhould fall downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and begge mercie at thy hands, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his petition ſhould eſpie his enemie, and ſurceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to intreat thee, ſhould go about to murther him; would it not mooue thee to greater anger againſt him than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Couldeſt thou poſſibly think him worthy of mercy? thinke it is thus &amp; no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with God himſelfe. But perhaps thou wilt ſay, from this time forward, or ſo long as I am not in charity I wil not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8926:86"/>ſay the Lords praier, or at leaſtwiſe, I wil omit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (As wee forgiue thoſe that treſpaſſe againſt vs.) <hi>Reſp.</hi> Except thou praie as Chriſt hath taught thee, thou art not Chriſts diſciple: Hee that made this praier, is hee that heares it; if thou ſhalt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this condition, Chriſt will not know that praier that he hath made; and as thou haſt ſhut out mercy in thy praiers towards thy neighbour, ſo God wil ſhut the gate of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt thee.</p>
               <p>Wherfore (deare brother) if thou wilt haue thy ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen thee of God, forgiue thou thy brother, not onely with thy outward lippes, but thy heart too; not with a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned peace, but a ſincere loue;

               <p>But let vs yeeld vnto thee that thou didſt neuer offend

Whereas if all men were perfect, how couldeſt thou ſuffer any thing for Gods cauſe? Many times it falleth out, that thine enemie doth

There is nothing more greeuous to a man than the remembrance of forepaſſed wrongs, and one man cannot wiſh a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſchiefe to another, than to wiſh him haunted with this diuell malice, and deſire of reuenge. For as the firſt thing that a worme feeds vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, is the wood wherein he is bred, ſo wrath doth firſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8926:102"/>hurt and afflict his hart, from whence it ſpringeth. Thy minde of it ſelfe is vnquiet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and doeſt thou with hatred and malice increaſe and exaſperate it? Thou haſt many other croſſes from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes, and yet thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeſt thy burthen, and art not at peace with thy owne heart. Firſt ſuppreſſe thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar enemie, that is, thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall concupiſcence, before thou prouide to make warre againſt others. For though thou be able to ouercome all the enemies thou haſt, yet new will ariſe, whereof ſome will ſooner oppreſſe thee than thou all. See now which of the two is the more eaſie, to retaine rancour, or to leaue it. As it is eaſie and light for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8926:102"/>an humble man to quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of enuie and malice, ſo is it a matter of great difficultie to a man of a proud ſpirit. If thou call to mind the paſſion of Chriſt, there is nothing ſo hard that with a willing mind thou maiſt not beare. Doeſt thou not remember how much more hard and bitter things Chriſt hath ſuffered when he laid downe his own ſoule for thee? How great and how many ſlanderous reproches ſufferered he of the Iewes? How many blowes? How many ſcourgings being mute and ſilent? How pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie turned hee not his face from the prophane ſpittings of wicked men? How meekly did he yeeld his diuine head to the crown of thorns? How
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8926:103"/>contentedly when hee was thirſty, did hee take the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of gall? How wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly being life it ſelfe, did he ſuffer death? But who? and by whom hath hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe cruelties? The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by his creatures; God by men, the lord by his ſeruants: the giuer of all good things, by vngrateful wretches, than which, what thing can bee more intolerable? And yet being ſcourged with whips, crowned with thorns, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with nailes, crucified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnmindfull of all theſe his miſeries and torments, hee ſtill pitieth thoſe that pitie not him, healeth thoſe that wound him, giueth life to thoſe that kil him, when with a pleaſing acceptance, much
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:8926:103"/>deuotion of ſpirit &amp; fulneſſe of charity, hee doth not only ſpare vnto his enemies the life of that holy Lambe, but praieth vnto his Father for them, ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 23.</note> Father forgiue them, they know not what they doe. Heere conſider, the manifold miſeries of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there the manifold mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his heart, and neuer forget his abundant charitie and wonderfull patience; for he tolerateth thoſe hee could puniſh, and caſt into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit of hell. Hee that iudgeth, and to whom the Father hath giuen all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not reuenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but forgetteth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth his wrongs, yea prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his perſecutors, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto vs an example of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8926:104"/>his patience, that we may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps, that as often as others ſhall offend vs, we may bee ſtirred vp to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not reuenge. For if our maſter when hee was murdered did loue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, how much more ought the diſciple to loue them whileſt he liueth? But thou a baſe &amp; contemptible worme, a polluted peece of dung, when thou ſeeſt the King of glory forgiuing his contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, pardoning the agonies and torments of his Croſſe, art yet (being prouoked with the leaſt wrong that may be) ſtirred vp to furie and deſire of reuenge, and offereſt grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wrongs than thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: Thou doeſt what hurt thou canſt, and thou
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8926:104"/>threatneſt more than thou canſt; and when thou canſt not or dareſt not openly to reuenge thy wrongs, thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly fretteſt and boileſt with malice, and in vain thou afflicteſt thy ſelfe, and not thy enemie. For as the good will of a man when there wants ability of performance hath a reward, ſo thy ill will, ſeeking after reuenge ſcapes not vnpuniſhed, becauſe God conſidereth not ſo much what thou haſt done, as what thou wouldſt haue done, if thou hadſt been able. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (deare brother) incline the obſtinacy of thy impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent minde to mercy, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſteps of our lord and maſter, let it not ſeeme hard vnto thee to forgiue thy
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8926:105"/>enemy, as often as thy enemy ſhall offend thee; that euery day thoſe ſinnes may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that thou doeſt euery day commit, that whileſt thou pardoneſt thy neighbor light and ſmall wrongs, God may pardon thee great and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous. For if thou truly repent, thou muſt prepare thy ſelf to endure wrongs, and neuer be mooued, when thou heareſt thy ſinnes obiected againſt thee.</p>
               <p>By this which hath beene ſpoken thou plainly ſeeſt, in how damnable a ſtate thou liueſt, ſo long as thou harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt malice and rancor in thy heart againſt thy neighbour. To the end therefore thou maieſt become a new man,
<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> if thou haue any thing againſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8926:105"/>thy neighbour forgiue it, and God will forgiue thee; which if thou doe not, thinke it is vaine for thee to beg forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at Gods hands; for ſuch as thou art towards thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſeruant, thou ſhalt finde him. Thou haſt power, nay there is a neceſſity impoſed vpon thee to forgiue any man that ſhall wrong thy ſelfe for any cauſe whatſoeuer, but if he ſhall ſinne againſt God, or his neighbour, it is not in thy power to remit, but thou art to vſe thy beſt indeuour to haue him puniſhed by law, not out of ill will, but out of that will wherewith a father correcteth his childe whom hee cannot hate. But thou contrarily in the wrongs of God and thy neighbour art
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8926:106"/>calme and quiet, but in thy owne thou art furious and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, wherein thou expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thy little loue towards God and thy neighbor. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any wonder at all, if thou loueſt not God whom thou canſt not ſee, when thou canſt not loue thy neighbour whom thou ſeeſt &amp; knoweſt; whom if thou haue firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, bee firſt reconciled vnto him; if he be thy enemy be friendly to him, that thou maieſt ſo win him to bee thy friend; and though hee haue firſt offended thee, yet bee thou firſt reconciled vnto him, and ſo thou ſhalt winne vnto thy ſelfe a twofold bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, one becauſe thou haſt patiently endured wrong, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other becauſe thou art the

Men look vpon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; God ſearcheth the hart. God ſeeth not as man ſeeth, man lookes vpon the face, God vpon the heart. There is no creature inuiſible to his eies, but all things are naked and open vnto him. He ſeeth, he beholdeth all things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any place hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from his omnipotencie. To him all hearts lie open, all wils ſpeake, and hee pierceth into the depth of euery mans

Before thou diddeſt commit theſe ſinnes hee knew them, when thou diddeſt commit them hee was preſent, and canſt thou think, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them not, he can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them? Yea by how much the more thou refuſeſt to confeſſe thy ſinnes, by ſo much the more doeſt thou lay them open before God.</p>
               <p>Thou hideſt not thy ſelfe from the Lord, but the Lord from thee; for thou takeſt a courſe not to ſee him that ſeeth all things, not that hee ſhould ſee thee: Thou canſt not ſee him, but yet inuiſibly hee ſeeth all that thou doeſt. Doeſt thou thinke thy ſinnes are not ſeene by him, becauſe they are not puniſhed by
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8926:114"/>him? Yea hee is ſo much the more angrie with thee, becauſe hee vouchſafeth not euen now to bee angrie with thee. Now is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou abuſeſt the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long ſufferance of ſo good and mercifull a God. For the Lord hath ſeene thy ſinnes, not that he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them, but condemne them; not to fauour them, but to puniſh them; not that hee might alwaies ſuffer and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, but at the laſt puniſh thee with a more heauie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. For doeſt thou thinke that God is like vnto thee? That he ſeeth thy ſinnes, and will let them paſſe vnpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Indeed he were like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſelfe if he would do ſo,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:8926:115"/>but aſſure thy ſelfe, he doth but deferre the puniſhment, he taketh it not away. Thou on the other fide wilt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not puniſh them, but caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt them behind thy backe, leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſee them.

Feare therefore now, leſt thou feare then; and let his feare prouoke thee to confeſſe thy ſinne, and baniſh

If thou wilt flie from the anger of God, flie vnto his mercie by confeſſing thy ſinnes, not by concealing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thou maieſt confeſſe, hide thou canſt not.</p>
               <p>Begin therefore with an humble confeſſion of thy ſins, to enter into the mercy of God, and to the end thou maieſt be iuſtified, bee thine owne accuſer. For God is iuſt, and hateth ſin, and will not ſuffer it to goe vnpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but yet he is likewiſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and pardoneth ſinne to him that repenteth; hee kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth iuſtice in mercy, and mercy in iuſtice; and therefore it cannot bee but that a iuſt God will iuſtly haue mercy

And therfore can it ſeeme vnto thee but iuſt &amp; requiſite, that thou confeſſe thy ſelfe a miſerable creature that thou maiſt obtaine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?

What can it profit thee to haue a cloſe &amp; a hidden conſcience, ſince thou haſt God a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all thy wickedneſſe? Whatſoeuer thou doeſt, God is a ſpectatour, and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall obſeruer of all, euen the leaſt thoughts of thy heart.

               <p>But yet thou iudgeſt of God, in whom there is no gall nor bitterneſſe, who is immutable, impaſſible, as thou iudgeſt of men. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth iuſt vnto man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his wrong; to God to remit and forgiue an offence to him that is penitent. It is the maner of a maſter, when he is offended by his ſeruant, to forbidde him his ſight, to turne his face from him, to denie him forgiueneſſe; but yet betwixt God and thee it is otherwiſe: for thogh thou by the pride of thy heart be
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:8926:123"/>turned from God, and God in iuſtice turned from thee, yet when with an humble &amp; contrite heart thou turneſt to him, hee diſdaineth not with mercie and compaſſion to turne vnto thee. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he that from all eternities hath beene alwaies immutable, is no way ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to change or alteration: the ſimplicitie of his nature no perturbation can wound, no paſſion can affect. But foraſmuch as wee can not ſpeake of God but after the maner of men, therefore wee call the temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God his anger, the ſentence of eternall damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his furie, the free bountie of his goodneſſe his mercie, and ſo of the reſt, becauſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8926:124"/>theſe are the works of a man angrie, furious, mercifull, and diuerſly affected: but yet ſo, that alwayes we cenſure him a good God, we ſeeke him in the ſimplicitie of our hearts, and we aſſure our ſelues there is nothing in him that is not God himſelfe. For he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a heauy iudgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſion, and puniſheth the vnrighteous being milde and mercifull. Neither in theſe or any his other works whatſoeuer is there in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alteration or ſhadow of changing. And as heere by the heat of the ſunne manie things are brought to paſſe, without any change in it ſelf, or in the heat thereof, but onely in thoſe things vpon which it worketh: ſo the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8926:124"/>God of the whole world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his eternall will doth euery day create many things, and giues them exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence without any motion or change of himſelfe. But yet as a mariner when the ſhip lancheth from the ſhore thinks the ſhore parts from him, whereas that remaines firme and immoueable, &amp; he departeth from it: And as if a man ſhut his eyes, refuſing to beholde the ſunne, there is no alteration in the ſun, but in his eyes: ſo God whileſt he doth any thing that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth new vnto vs, though it were in his will before all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and either ſheweth mercie, or powreth his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon a man, whileſt man by ſinne is turned from
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:8926:125"/>God, there is no change in God, but only in man cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe after a diuers maner. But thou departeſt from God, not by any locall diſtance, becauſe as the ſoule of a man is all in all the body, and all in euery part thereof, and yet becauſe it hath the greateſt operation in the hart is ſayd eſpecially to reſide there; ſo God though eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he be ſaid to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, becauſe there hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his glorie to his ſaints, yet he is wholly euery where ſubſtantially, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the globe of the whole world, though to our carnall eyes the ſimplicitie of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bee inuiſible. This his preſence in all places is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen euery where, whileſt in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:8926:125"/>all things that are created there appeareth his coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuſtentation, and guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, without which they would preſently vaniſh and fall to nothing; as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our owne ſoules can no otherwiſe bee deſcried, than by the vitall operations thereof in it own body. Thou departeſt therfore from God not by any locall ſeparation, becauſe thou interpoſeſt the barre and partition wall of thy ſinnes betwixt God and thee: for as a wall makes a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration betwixt the eie and the light; ſo ſinne betwixt God and man. And as the life of the body is the ſoule, ſo the life of the ſoule is God: and as the bodie dies if the ſoule forſake it, ſo the ſoule
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:8926:126"/>dies if God forſake it: as the outward death ſeparateth the ſoule from the bodie, ſo the inward death the ſoule from God. O how great a wretchedneſſe is it to bee farre from him that is euery where, and to bee without him, without whom no man can be in ſafetie! And yet he alwayes departed vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from man, and by his will forſaketh no man. He is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer abſent, if not firſt expeld; whom whileſt by ſinne thou ſhutteſt out of doores, thou excludeſt thy ſelfe from thy own ſaluation, but God thou harmeſt not. As if from the root of the vine (I am the vine,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.</note> you the branches, ſayth the Lord) a branch bee not plucked, it beareth much
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8926:126"/>fruit, and receiueth nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the root, which if it be plucked from the vine hurts not the vine, becauſe the vine miniſtreth vitall nouriſhment to the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, not they to the vine; ſo to thoſe that are in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and Chriſt in them, many giſts and graces flow from him, which are beneficiall vnto Chriſtians, not to Chriſt. One branch being plucked from the vine, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpringeth from the root thereof, but that which is pluckt can not liue without a root, but withereth, and is gathered vp, and caſt into the fire. And as he that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his eyes from the light, hurts not the light, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in changing darkneſſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8926:127"/>for light; ſo whileſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeſt to ſtick vnto God who is the light of thy ſoule, thou falleſt into blindneſſe and darkeneſſe, not of thy eyes, but of thy maners; not of thy outward eyes wherewith thou diſcerneſt white from blacke, but of thy inward, wherewith thou ſhouldeſt iudge of that which is iuſt and vniuſt. For as in that place that is not lightned by the beames of the ſunne, the motes are not diſcerned, ſo thou that art fallen from the grace of Gods diuine illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, committeſt manie things that are ſinnes, and yet perceiueſt it not; wheras they that are inlightned with the ſunne of righteouſneſſe, doe both diligentlie prie into
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:8926:127"/>them, and ſtraitly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them. Thou that art fallen from the inward grace of Gods diuine illumination, (but yet not altogether ſo long as thou art in this life) into the inward darkneſſe &amp; blindneſſe of thy minde, if thou perſiſt in this thy blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the end, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the receiuing of the grace of his illumination from the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, at the laſt thou falleſt into vtter darkneſſe, and a night of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, being far remooued from him, that dwelleth in that light that is inacceſſible. Moreouer, whils by ſinne thou departeſt from God (who is all good, onely good, &amp; without whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is good) thou no way
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:8926:128"/>damnifieſt God (who hath no need of thee or thine) but being depriued of thy chiefe and greateſt good, thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt into the greateſt miſeries that may be. And this let me tell thee, that though of thy ſelfe, and by thy owne will thou haddeſt power to fall from good to euill, yet of thy ſelfe, and by thy onely will, thou haſt not power to ariſe from euill to good; thou art fallen by thine owne will into the pit of ſinne, but yet at thine owne will and pleaſure thou canſt not be freed from thence. For the wound is not ſo eaſily cured as giuen, and no man can ſo eaſily get out of the pit as fall into it. But as he can hardly get out, except ſome one or other let downe
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:8926:128"/>a line vnto him, which he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of may dragge him out; ſo except the grace of God deſcend vpon thee, thou canſt neuer get out of the pit of ſinne; but yet thou muſt know that this grace of God, is alwaies ready to help thee, and to draw thee foorth of the pit, doe thou only take hold of the mercy of God when it is offered, and applie thy will vnto his will, and all ſhall be well.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy, who like a carefull nurſe directeth and beareth vp her little infant, vntill it bee able to goe of it ſelfe; So the Lord (who can denie himſelfe to none) in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:8926:129"/>the beginning of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beareth with our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and annointeth our wounds with the oile of his mercy, leſt the danger of our diſeaſe, and the difficultie of the cure ſhould any way ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie or amaze vs. And this he doth foure maner of wais: For to a man that by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance turneth vnto him, but yet by long cuſtome is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in his ſinnes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of his mercie hee ſendeth tribulations, which poſſeſſe the minde of him that repenteth, and expell that delight of ſin that ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon him: Sometimes he taketh away the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of falling, and ſuffereth not the weakneſſe of a man to bee tempted: Sometimes
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8926:129"/>hee giueth ſtrength to reſiſt temptations, which manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſting, he may feele, but not yeeld vnto: Somtimes he cureth the affections, that he doeth not onely not conſent, but not feel the power therof.</p>
               <p>But to a ſinner that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth the grace of God, and refuſeth to follow the good inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his ſpirit, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not his grace in ſo great a meaſure, but yet ſo long as he liueth he doeth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together withdraw it, but he ſtandeth and knocketh at the doore of his conſcience, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his drowſy wil &amp; dead deſires. But yet many times he withdraweth ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all helpes heereunto, as infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the body, loſſe of temporall goods, &amp; the like,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:8926:130"/>which are meanes to draw a miſerable ſinner to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For many times hee giueth temporal bleſſings out of his anger, which out of loue hee would not haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and permitteth a ſinner to doe that, which he ſhould not ſo much as intertaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his thought. As a Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that hath vſed all the Art hee can to cure a diſeaſe; ſo ſoone as he ſeeth his patient to refuſe that Phyſicke he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth vnto him, he leaueth him to himſelfe, as a man that refuſeth to liue; and becauſe hee deſpaireth of his health, he giueth him leaue to take whatſoeuer hee deſireth: So God in his iuſt iudgement ſuffereth a ſinner to be giuen ouer according to the deſires
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8926:130"/>and luſts of his owne heart to a reprobate ſenſe, as into the hands of a cruell maſter, to doe thoſe things that are not ſit. Not becauſe God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth his affections vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but becauſe hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his grace, whereby man ſhould bee conuerted. Yea and hee ſometime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth a man to doe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet to liue happily, not exerciſing his furie vpon him, nor reuenging his ſinne with any temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but reſerueth him to eternall damnation, than which nothing can be worſe; for then is the anger of God greateſt, when hee ſheweth not himſelfe to bee angrie with a ſinner. Againe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord puniſheth
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:8926:131"/>ſome things, to the end that a ſinner yet liuing, might learne to flie from future ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; ſomethings hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnreuenged, to the end he may know there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yet a farther iudgement for him. Sometimes hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth that puniſhment heere in this life, which hee endeth after this life with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation. For if God ſhould neere reuenge himſelfe of all his wrongs, to what end ſhould wee looke for the laſt iudgement?</p>
               <p>By that which hath beene ſpoken, thou maieſt gather (deare brother) that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee not, but before hee forſaketh thee, thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him, neither is the fault in him, that by repentance
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8926:131"/>thou turneſt not vnto him, but in the obſtinacie of thine owne will, who refuſeſt to heare his voice, or obey his diuine inſpirations. The Sun ſhineth vpon the window, only doe thou open it, and it will enter in. Accuſe not therefore God, but thy ſelfe; for in God, who is iuſt in all his wayes and holy in all his works, there is nothing to be reprehended, or condemned. For as if by reaſon of the weakneſſe of thy body thou art not able to goe, another ſhould lend thee his hand to lift thee vp, and to hold thee whileſt thou walkeſt, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeſt his helpe, and haddeſt rather lie vpon the ground, than be holpon by him, the fault is not his, but thine, if
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8926:132"/>thou riſe not; euen ſo the Lord of his owne accord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himſelfe vnto thee, and is alwayes readie to helpe thee beare the burthen of thy ſinnes, and to direct thy ſteps into the right way; doe thou only apply thy will vnto his will, and be willing to receiue that grace and fauour which he offereth vnto thee.</p>

               <p>AFter that the God of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience &amp; long ſufferance hath a long time expected the conuerfion of thee a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hee giueth to thee not conuerting, but contemning
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8926:132"/>his patience, greater ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blockes to fall: for whileſt thou art eareleſſe to redeeme thy leſſer ſinnes, by little and little thou falleſt lower and lower, and being inſenſibly ſeduced by vſe &amp; cuſtome, thou groweſt bolde to commit greater ſinnes. When the tongue hath once liberty to vtter idle ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, it ſhortly after growes bolde to vtter any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and whileſt thou art giuen to gluttonie, thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt into drunkenneſſe, yea madneſſe it ſelfe: for as for the moſt part it falleth out, that one diſeaſe ingendereth another, and that hee that is ouerladen with a great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then doth eaſily fall; ſo the burthen of ſinne which by
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8926:133"/>repentance is not ſpeedily ſhaken off, with the burthen thereof preſſeth a man to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinnes, and one ſinne is the cauſe of another, and the latter a puniſhment to the firſt; as a righteous man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth from one virtue to another, and from one good worke taketh occaſion to do another. One ſinne may be the cauſe of another three maner of wayes; ſometimes by reaſon of the finall cauſe, as murther is committed for couetouſneſſe; ſometimes by reaſon of the materiall cauſe; as when by ſuperfluity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et gluttony ingendreth luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; vaine glorie whileſt it ſeeketh the glory of a vaine name, leſt another ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it, ingendreth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8926:133"/>ſometimes by reaſon of an inueterat cuſtom, as when the cuſtome of one ſinne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a man to another. By theſe three meanes a ſinner falling from ſinne to ſinne, at the laſt runneth himſelfe into the bottomleſſe pit of all ſin, and God in his iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hardeneth his heart in ſuch a maner, that he that by repentance would not clenſe his ſinne, heapeth vp ſinne vpon ſinne, and wallowing in his owne filth, groweth more filthy. Sinne that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not taken away, is both a ſinne and the cauſe of another ſin, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the mind of a ſinner is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ingaged; but that ſinne that ariſeth out of another ſinne, is both a ſinne and the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:8926:134"/>puniſhment of a former ſin, and ſometimes the cauſe of a following ſinne too. So that in this life ſinnes are reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſinnes, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinnes are not torments, but increaſe of ſinnes: the facilitie likewiſe of committing ſinne is made the puniſhment of precedent ſinnes: of all which the laſt puniſhment is the fire of hell. Neuertheleſſe, a ſinner being hardned in his ſinnes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his inſenſible hardnes, knowes not himſelfe to bee puniſhed heereby, vntill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will hee feele by a manifeſt puniſhment, how great that ſinne is which hee willingly committed.

By reſiſting thoſe firſt morions, thou art troubled with a preſent labour, but freed from that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting; whereas by not

But how ſhall there bee a fight, if there want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to fight? Yea and the fruit of this crowne is greater vnto him, that hath made the greateſt fight for it. Take away the battels of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of God, take away their crownes too; take away their afflictions, thou haſt taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their bleſſings; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations cannot be but good, ſince it works in vs an vnſpeakeable weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

Wilt thou not bee tempted? thou maieſt as well ſay thou wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue, becauſe temptation is the life of man vpon earth. The life of man is not ſaid to haue temptation, but that it is a temptation; becauſe as the ſea cannot bee without waues and billows, ſo cannot the life of man want temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And as, when thou walkeſt by the way, the dogges barke at thee, whom if thou neglect and prouoke not, yet though they bite thee not, they will ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee barking: ſo though thou withſtand temptations, yet thou ſhalt not free thy ſelfe from them; but if one ſhall depart, be ſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

There is a deadly fight with the world and the diuell, but more dangerous with the fleſh, becauſe it is inteſtine.

               <p>With this enemy whileſt thou fighteſt, God animareth thee; when thou fainteſt, he ſuſteineth thee, that thou yeeld not; when thou yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not, he helpeth thee that thou mayeſt ouercome, and ouercomming hee crowneth thee that thou mayeſt reigne with him. Outwardly hee ſeemes to leaue thee to thy proofe, and inwardly he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth thee that thou periſh not. Thou art ſtricken with temptations outwardly, but inwardly the hand of thy Creator holdeth thee vp, leſt thou fall. The Lord neuer forſaketh him that is in the way to righteouſneſſe, leſt

For if the diuell could hurt as much as he would, in a ſhort time there ſhuld not a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man be left.

The negligence of man makes the diuell ſtrong, not his owne power: for he tempteth daily, that whom by force hee can not conquer, hee may at the laſt ouercome by a tedious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute.

               <p>O fading and deceitful life full of many ſnares!
<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of a ſinner dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day I did reioice, now I am ſorie; then I laught, now I weepe; then I was ſtrong, now I am weake; then I liued, now I die; then I ſeemed happie, now am ſerable and a wretched creature. I do not ſo much lament my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this life, as the loſſe of thoſe daies, and moneths, and yeeres, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue laboured in vaine, and in vaine haue ſpent the ſtrength of my daies. All the time that was giuen mee to liue, I haue ſpent in all maner
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:8926:171"/>of ſinne and iniquitie, and ſo long as I liued, I rather obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mine own concupiſcence, than the inſpirations &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God. This rotten carcaſe of mine, which the wormes are preſently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, I euer tooke care to helpe and to comfort; but my ſoule, which preſentlie ſhall be brought before God and his Angels vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I contemned,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.27.</note> &amp; tooke no care with vertue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to adorne it: and this is the cauſe why my ſoule is vexed within mee. O my vanitie, ô my pride, ô my pleaſure! whether are yee gone, what haue you profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me? What haue you left vnto me for all the ſeruice I haue done vnto you in the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:8926:172"/>whole courſe of my life? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a gnawing and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting conſcience. For your ſeruice I made my ſelfe an enemie vnto God, a ſlaue to the diuell; I loſt heauen and got hell; I loſt infinite ioies, and got eternall lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; I am depriued of the ſocietie of Angels, and haue made my ſelfe a companion to the citizens of nell. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and riches and honors, with all the fading allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this deceitful world, are paſt and gone, and they are as if they neuer had been,

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:8926:172"/>ſhip in the ſea, whoſe path is not ſeene. The time of my life is paſt and glided away, &amp; it cannot return; in whoſe, though ſhorteſt delay, ô how much good could I haue done; ô how great a treaſure of ſpirituall goods could I haue gathered vnto my ſelfe, which now in my fading time might haue made mee friends in the eternall taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of God! of the leaſt whereof I ſhould now more reioice, than of millions of gold and ſiluer. But a good purpoſe without a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a will without worke, good promiſes without exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the expectation of a morrow that neuer came, haue vndone me: Wo be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me that ſo long put it off,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:8926:173"/>ſo long delayed my conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. How happie is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repentance and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe ſecure! Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee that repenteth too late can neuer bee ſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee knoweth not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee repent truely or fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, for it is likely that hee rather repenteth out of a feare of puniſhment than out of loue towards God. O my gold and ſiluer, ô my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, my precious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherein I was wont to content my ſelfe! I faile you, you faile not me; I leaue you, I can not carrie you with mee. Oh that I had beene ſo happie as neuer to haue ſeene you, that of all men liuing I had beene the pooreſt! for then had I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:8926:173"/>beene called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, either for miſſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or vniuſtly detaining you. O that I had beene of all the ſhepheards in the field the baſeſt, and had had the charge but onely of my ſelfe! for then would not the Lord require at my hands the ſouls of thoſe my ſubiects, whoſe ſaluation I haue neglected. O my riches, my honours, my delights! yee cannot free me from death, from ſtench, from worms, from rottennes, yee cannot plucke me out of the hands of the liuing God. O death doſt thou oppreſſe mee vnawares? How bitter vnto me is the remembrance of thee! how fearefull is thy preſence! Whereas if liuing and in health I had foreſeene
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8926:174"/>thee, and by liuing well had learnt to die well, I had not now feared thee. Bleſſed art thou <hi>Arſenus,</hi> who alwaies haddeſt this houre before thine eies. Three things there are which I now greatly feare. Firſt, when my ſoule ſhall depart out of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this my bodie, into a place which it knoweth not. Secondly, when it is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the Iudge, and to bee preſented before his tribunall ſeat. Thirdly, when it is to heare that irreuocable ſentence either with it, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>But thou my Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie it is alwaies to haue mercy and to forgiue; who haſt ſaid; That at what time
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8926:174"/>ſoeuer a ſinner repenteth him of his ſinne, thou wilt put out all his wickedneſſe out of thy remembrance; though I haue contemned thoſe times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that thou haſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded me, of all other men haue moſt offended thee, am altogether vnwoorthy to be called thy ſonne, yet minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thy mercies which haue beene from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, giue mee thy aſſiſtance to eſcape this death, &amp; ſome ſmall time to my wiſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Adde ſome few yeeres to my life, ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, or at leaſt ſome daies. Giue mee leaue a little, that I may lament my ſinnes, and call to minde my forepaſſed yeeres in the bitterneſſe of mine owne ſoule; becauſe if
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:8926:175"/>I die in this ſtate I am now in, my end muſt needs be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation. But if out of thy meere mercy &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thou ſhalt pardon mee, I will be bold, with thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſſiſtance to promiſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement of life: onely in this ſtate let not my ſoule die, leſt it bee buried in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit of hell.</p>

               <p>For if golde ſhine in the fire and is not conſumed by it, and the mountaines in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia</hi> from the beginning of the world vnto this day burn with continuall fire, and yet continue whole and entire; if the Salamander can liue in the fire without paine; how
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:8926:194"/>much more poſſible is it that the body and ſoule may feele the paine of this fire, and yet alwayes liue? Againe, as the ſoule giuing life vnto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die can ſuffer griefe, but yet can not die; euen ſo whileſt the bodie hath put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie and incorruption, the ſoule with the body ſhall alwayes be tormented, but not conſumed: for by a fire vnquenchable (which in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye is able to conſume the greateſt hill that is) a ſinner ſhall not be extinguiſhed nor conſumed, but euer there ſhal remaine and abound ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him to be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>And becauſe there is no true life, but where a man
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:8926:194"/>liues happily; and where an vnhappy man is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to die, in him death it ſelfe dies not: therefore a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that hath both loſt his well being, and yet hath not left eſſentially to be; that is euer dead to eternall life, and for euer liuing to eternall death, is compelled daily to ſuffer both death without death, and want without want, and end without end. So hee dies that hee may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes liue, and ſo hee liues that he may alwayes die; ſo he decayes as that he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſubſiſt, and ſo he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth that hee alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes; ſo he is ended, that he is without end, and ſo is hee with an end, that he is neuer ended. And he whoſe dead
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:8926:195"/>life was heere in ſinne, there his liuing death is in paine. There hee deſireth onely death, which heere hee ſo much hated; hee ſeeketh death, and findeth it not; he deſireth to die, and death fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from him; heere it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly drawen forth of the body, there in the body it is vnwillingly deteined; the death of nature doth violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driue the ſoule out of the body, the death of hell more violently detaines it in the body: of both deaths that is commonly had, that the ſoul ſuffereth of the bodie what it would not.</p>
               <p>What end of yeeres may be imagined, ſo it be finite, to the damned is exceeding comfortable; but out and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:8926:195"/>in hell there is no redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; neither was there euer any man knowen to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from thence: for hell is ſo deepe, that no man may aſcend from thence; ſo cloſe, that no man may get out; ſo kept, that no men can eſcape; he that is once gone thither, can no more returne; that is once entred, can neuer get forth: whom the iuſtice of God hath once drawen to puniſhment, the mercie of God neuer reduceth vnto pardon.</p>
               <p>It belongeth to the iuſtice of a ſeuere and rigorous Iudge, that there be no end of reuenge giuen vnto them, who ſo long as they were in health would neuer make an end of ſinning; that there

Againe, it is fit and requiſit, that according to the delight of ſinne the bitterneſſe of their torment ſhould be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured vnto them, not onely which the wicked haue had, but which they would haue: for God doth not only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the outward actions, but hee likewiſe examineth the inward willes. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:8926:196"/>out of the corruption of their owne willes they haue giuen no meaſure to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of ſinne, nor euer could finde ſo great delight in ſinne but that they would haue greater, therefore God (who conſidereth the heart, not the outward action) inflicteth puniſhment, not according to the delight receiued, but ſought after; that the time of their torment for ſinne might be infinite, who were infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted therein. Againe, foraſmuch as there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of greatneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the offence and the partie offended, therefore ſinne, whereby God infinite in goodneſſe and maieſtie is offended, muſt neceſſarily be iudged infinite, and deſerueth
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:8926:197"/>an infinite puniſhment; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in continuance, not in paine or torment: for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite capacitie of a creature is not capable of what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit; whom likewiſe the Lord (who deteineth not his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies when he is angry) puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not according to their deſert, for he is mercifull, and taketh no delight in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; but yet becauſe hee is iuſt hee is neuer pacified from reuenge. For as they that forſake life, runne into death, ſo they that feare not to offend, and to forſake him that is good in the higheſt degree, deſerue in the higheſt degree to be puniſhed; and they are made worthy of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall euill, who deſtroy in themſelues that good that
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:8926:197"/>might haue been eternall. As wee ſee that a temporall or tranſitory puniſhment brings a death which is perpetuall, a temporall treaſon a yoke of perpetuall ſeruitude; a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is taken in a ſhort time, which a man perhaps ſhall neuer ſhake off: ſo the ſinnes of the damned haue an end, but yet their puniſhment for ſinne is deſeruedly endleſſe, who are ſorrie they haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; yet cannot but ſinne</p>
               <p>And though God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and willing to pardon all ſinnes whatſoeuer, yet when hee puniſheth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate for their ſinnes, hee leaueth not ſo much as an idle word, nay thought, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed; and they that are debtors for great ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:8926:198"/>condemned, muſt pay the vttermoſt farthing. And as hee that hath his arme bound can doe nothing with it; ſo out of the bitterneſſe of the paine, not the loue of God, they haue a willing will to riſe from their ſinnes, but yet being forſaken of GOD. Which will of theirs though it haue loſt the effect of power, bee not able, yet it hath alwaies the affection to ſinne, and though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſinne, yet they loſe not their will to ſinne. For it is true that death ſeparateth the ſoule from the fleſh, but yet it changeth not the purpoſe of the ſoule. For as with the elect the good will of a man is turned into glory; ſo with the reprobate their ill will is

This ſinne is ſaid to be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible, not becauſe it can not be forgiuen to him that repenteth, but becauſe hee that ſo ſinneth, doth either deſpaire, or preſume of the mercy of God, and ſo addeth ſinne vnto ſinne, and neuer repenteth: and ſo being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in his wickedneſſe, as ſeldome or neuer he comes to repentance, ſo ſeldome or neuer he obteineth remiſſion of his ſinnes. But yet we are not to deſpaire of any ſinner

O the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy of God! we ſin and he ſpareth, we offend and he pardoneth; we haue
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:8926:229"/>offended him in manie things, hee withdraweth his bleſſings from vs in nothing: whereby hee ſheweth how good a God he is toward the iuſt, who is ſo mercifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners.</p>

Our mercifull Father weepeth, that he might not ſaue thoſe that were deſperately wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and doeſt thou doubt hee will not be mercifull to thee, turning vnto him?
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:8926:229"/>There are two arguments in him of his naturall goodnes and clemencie, his longani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in expecting, and his facilitie in pardoning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee both patiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth ſinners, and louingly receiueth penitent ſinners: he both by his patience tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth the ſinnes of men, and by their repentance releaſeth them, that they may returne, though late, and be aſhamed that they ſhould be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whenſoeuer they are conuerted, hee forgetteth ſinnes paſt, and he promiſeth future amendment. Oh the great patience of God! hee ſpareth contempts, pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth denials; he ſeeth thee to ſinne, and yet hee ſuffereth thee: firſt he forbiddeth thee

Thou wilt not doe the will of God for thine owne good, thine owne commodity, how then ſhould hee heare thee in the day of thy tribulation praying vnto him, when

If he would not haue mercy on thee, thou wouldeſt intreat mercy at his hands, now hee would haue mercy, and thou wilt not; he inuiteth thee to repentance, and thou neglecteſt it. If thou feare not the iuſtice of God reuenging, at the leaſt bluſh at his goodneſſe calling thee vnto him; and thou that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtricken couldeſt haue ſuffered the puniſhment due vnto thy ſinnes, bluſh at the leaſt being expected; leſt whom thou now ſeeſt calme and peaceable, thou bee not able to behold angry and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable.

That ſentence, The ſoule that hath ſinned ſhall die, is to be vnderſtood of that ſoule which hath not repented of her ſinnes; as is ſayd of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane iudgements, That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man hath done this or that, he ſhall die the death; and yet alwaies it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, except the partie condemned, by the kings mercy be pardoned. The iuſtice of God is not as the iuſtice of man; in this, by how much the more a guilty man confeſſeth his fault, by ſo much the more puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth hee draw vpon
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:8926:235"/>himſelfe; but in that of God, by how much the more a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accuſeth himſelfe, by ſo much the more doth he finde the mercy of God towards him: as God repelleth him that defendeth his ſinnes, ſo hee receiueth him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth them. If thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the power of repentance, thou wouldeſt not deſpaire of the forgiueneſſe of thy ſinnes: our mercifull God doth gladly forget that wee are nocent, and he is alwayes ready to eſteeme our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as innocencie; for if we repent vs of our ſinnes, wee haue alreadie eſcaped the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of a ſeuere ſentence. God imputeth not vnto vs our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, ſo wee repent vs of it, but ſeeing our works chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:8926:236"/>he gladly changeth his ſentence, becauſe hee would the life of a ſinner, not the death; neither doth he take pleaſure in the perdition of ſoules, but his will is our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. To thoſe that ſtand, if they fall, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth puniſhment, that fearing that, they may not fall; but yet he promiſeth mercie to thoſe that fall, that truſting thereon, they may riſe again: thoſe he terrifieth, leſt they preſume in their goodneſſe; theſe he comforteth, leſt they ſhould deſpaire in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
               <p>As a kinde and louing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther threatneth ſtripes to her beloued ſonne, whom, if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his fault, hee beg mercy at her hands, her

A louing mother doth greatly deſire the health of her ſicke ſonne, but much more doth God deſire the ſaluation of a ſicke ſoule.

Yea whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it will, it can mooue and ouerthrow, and that with as little labour and endeuour, as a man moueth his eie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is, it is alwaies alike happy, becauſe it hath God alwaies preſent. This ſo great agilitie ſhall be acceptable and pleaſant, not becauſe it is neceſſarie, or that it hath it becauſe it hath any need of it, but only for the greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of glorie; as wee vſe not all thoſe perfections that
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:8926:264"/>we haue, and reioyce to haue.</p>
               <p>How great O Lord is the multitude of thoſe ioyes thou haſt prepared for thoſe that feare thee! Oh how much doeſt thou loue vs, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueſt vs miſerable &amp; wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſinners to ſo great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! Glorious things are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thee, ô citie of God; and therefore it ſhall be more poſſible for mee to number the ſtarres in the firmament, and to incloſe the whole ſea in a little veſſell, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the leaſt part of the bleſſednes of one ſoule. The ioyes thereof are ſuch, and ſo great, that all the Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of the world can not number it, the Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans meaſure it, the Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians with their tongues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:8926:264"/>it. It doth not onely exceed the power of our elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but the capacitie of our intelligence. Our thoght can conceiue it greater than our tongue vtter it, and yet it is greater than we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and whatſoeuer wee thinke thereof, is leſſe than it is, becauſe the eye hath not ſeen, the eare hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for thoſe that loue him. Faith apprehends it not, Hope attaines it not, Charity comprehends it not, becauſe it farre exceedeth all our vowes, all our deſires. It may be obteined, eſtimated it can not, for there is more to be gotten, than Faith could beleeue. Hope looke after.
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:8926:265"/>The rewards of GOD are greater than the deſires of his ſaints: for ſo great is the ſweetneſſe of that heauenly countrey, as that if a droppe thereof ſhould deſcend into hell, it would ſweeten all the ſorrowes of the damned: and if God could be ſeene by the damned in hell, hell were a Paradiſe. By this it euidently appeareth what and how great a good God is, ſince it can be well with none that depart from him. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne at the laſt vnto our ſelues, and deſcending as it were from heauen, let vs looke a litle vpon what is our owne. Doe wee thinke wee ſhall go into the houſe of the Lord? What are we, that we ſhould goe thither? Mortall
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:8926:265"/>and abiect creatures, earth and aſhes. But yet he that hath promiſed is our father, and is omnipotent. Can not he make an angell of a man, who made a man of the earth? By life we are men, by hope angels, to whom in our countrey we ſhall be like and equall. A merchant when he buyes a thing and takes aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for it, though as yet he haue not his wares, yet he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures himſelfe he ſhall haue them. God the Father hath promiſed vnto vs his glorie, and for an earneſt pennie, in the meane time, he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs his only Sonne, in the Sacrament of his bodie and blood, and hath inſpired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts his holy Spirit. There with an open face we
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:8926:266"/>ſhall ſee him, with greater ioy and more ſecurely, whom heere we ſee myſtically, yet fruitfully in his Sacrament. Deſpaire not therefore to come to this place, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the promiſe of thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>
               <p>Hope is neceſſarie for a wandring pilgrime, it is that that comforts him in the way; for a traueller that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boreth in his iourney is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore content with patience to beare his labour, becauſe at laſt he hopes to come to the end thereof: take away his hope of the end, and his ſtrength failes him, hee is preſently wearie with going. A Phyſitian drawes forth his inſtrument to lance a wound, and he ſayth to his Patient,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:8926:266"/>Be patient and beare a little: in the paine he requires pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but after the paine he promiſeth health: but the ſicke bodie, except he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto him hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery, he would faint in that paine which he endureth. In the warres the hope of honor mitigateth the griefe of the wounds: ſo to thoſe that beare the yoke of Chriſt, the hope of glory is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, raiſeth the minde vnto God, and that euill which they outwardly beare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they feele not.</p>
               <p>Hope brings no ſmall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when that which was hoped is once attained. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things not had, afflict; when they are had, ſeem baſe and contemptible. Thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt

It is to be feared leſt thou fall into another bottomleſſe pit, and thou die by preſuming of the mercy of God, that couldeſt not die by deſpairing of it; and thou haue in thy heart cogitations diuers from the former, but not leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and ſo thou beginneſt in thy heart to ſay: At what houre ſoeuer I ſhall repent, God will put out all my wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe out of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,

<pb n="532" facs="tcp:8926:272"/>them) not to ſuffer them to die in thee, and to do thy ſelfe no good. For as it is a dangerous thing vnto the body, not to be able to receiue corporall ſuſtenance, ſo is it more dangerous to the ſoule to loath ſpirituall delicacies.</p>
            <p>I knovv and am vvel aſſured, that vvhen this my exhortatory Epiſtle ſhall come vnto thy hands, thou vvilt call thy friends together and ſhevv it vnto them, &amp; of them take counſell vvhat thou ſhalt doe; who vvhileſt they loue not thee, but that vvhich is thine, vvil ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may offend, but flatter thee, vvhich thou maieſt the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke, becauſe their former counſels, euen in thine ovvn iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, haue corrupted thee; vvho to the end they may vvithdravv thee from that good counſell I giue thee, to follovv theirs, they vvill perhaps ſay vnto thee, I ſee a mote in thine eie, but cannot ſee the beame in mine ovvne; that I diſpraiſe thee, being to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and praiſe my ſelfe being

But yet I direct thee to the ſhore of repentance vvhileſt I flote in the ſea of mine ovvn ſins; I am auſtere about thy life, ouer gentle about mine ovvne, vvhereas thou ſhouldeſt rather heare mee, commanding thee vvhat is eaſie, practiſing that is hard, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult in my ſelfe.
